# The Build
The custom Ruby linter  checks for the following errors/warnings.
- check for wrong indentation
- check for trailing spaces
- check empty line error

## Built With
- Ruby
- RSpec for Ruby Testing

> These are examples of good and bad codes. The good practises of code and the bad practises are shown below.

# Good Code

class Testing_Error
  def school(name)
    @name = @name     
    @school = @school

class Testing_Error
  def school(name)
            @name = @name

  def school(name) ~
    @name = @name

# Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:

```
$ cd <folder>
```

```
$ git clonehttps://github.com/rayking12/Custom_linters
```

**To check for errors on a file:** 

~~~bash
$ bin/main new.rb
~~~
 **To test a file of no errors:**

 ~~bash
 $ bin/main corrected_method.rb
 ~~~

 ## Testing

To test the code, run `rspec` from root of the folder using terminal.
Note: `new.rb`&& `corrected_method` has been excluded from the rubocop test

> Rspec is used for the test, to install the gem file, run

~~~bash
$ bundle install 
~~~

> But before that, make sure you have **bundler** installed on your system, else run

~~~bash
$ gem install bundler 
~~~

> or you simply install the the following directly using
